# react-native-add-calendar-event

This package alows you to start an activity (Android) or show a modal window (iOS) for adding or editing events in device's calendar. Through a promise, you can find out if a new event was added and get its id. See the usage section for more information.

### Changes in 1.0.0

* `presentNewCalendarEventDialog` was renamed to `presentCalendarEventDialog`; the module now has basic support for editing existing events. Pass `eventId` in the options object if you want to edit an event instead of creating it.

* the module now returns `eventId` as string on both platforms (it used to return number on Android and string on iOS)

* bugfix: iOS used to return `calendarItemIdentifier`, now returns `eventIdentifier`

* bugfix: added a check that prevents Android from crashing with `CursorIndexOutOfBoundsException`

## Getting started

`npm install react-native-add-calendar-event --save`

or

`yarn add react-native-add-calendar-event`

### Mostly automatic installation

1.  `react-native link react-native-add-calendar-event`


2.  add `NSCalendarsUsageDescription` and `NSContactsUsageDescription` keys to your `Info.plist` file. The string value associated with the key will be used when asking user for calendar permission.

3.  rebuild your project

IOS note: If you use pods, `react-native link` will probably add the podspec to your podfile, in which case you need to run pod install. If not, please verify that the library is under `link binary with libraries` in the build settings in Xcode (see manual installation notes).


## Usage

see the example for a demo app

```js
import * as AddCalendarEvent from 'react-native-add-calendar-event';

const eventConfig = {
  title,
  // and other options
};

AddCalendarEvent.presentCalendarEventDialog(eventConfig)
  .then(eventId => {
    //handle success (receives event id) or dismissing the modal (receives false)
    if (eventId) {
      console.warn(eventId);
    } else {
      console.warn('dismissed');
    }
  })
  .catch((error: string) => {
    // handle error such as when user rejected permissions
    console.warn(error);
  });
};
```

### supported options:

| Property      | Value   | Note                                                                 |
| :------------ | :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| eventId       | String  | Id of edited event. Do not pass if you want to add a new event.      |
| title         | String  |                                                                      |
| startDate     | String  | format: 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ'                                   |
| endDate       | String  | format: 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ'                                   |
| location      | String  |                                                                      |
| url           | String  | iOS only                                                             |
| notes         | String  | The notes (iOS) or description (Android) associated with the event.  |
| useEditIntent | boolean | Android only, and only when editing an event. See description below. |

* useEditIntent: `ACTION_EDIT` should work for editing events, according to [android docs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/calendar-provider.html#intent-edit) but this doesn't always seem to be the case as reported in the [bug tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/u/1/issues/36957942?pli=1). This option leaves the choice up to you. By default, the module will use `ACTION_VIEW` which will only show the event, but from there it is easy for the user to tap the edit button and make changes.

The dates passed to this module are strings. If you use moment, you may get the right format via `momentInUTC.format('YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSS[Z]')` the string may look eg. like this: `'2017-09-25T08:00:00.000Z'`.

More options can be easily added, PRs are welcome!

It is recommended to not rely on the standard `Date` object and instead use some third party library for dealing with dates, such as moment.js because JavaScriptCore (which is used to run react-native on devices) handles dates differently from V8 (which is used when debugging, when the code runs on your computer).
